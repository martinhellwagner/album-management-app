# Album Management App

## Introduction

This iOS app project – which used to be available on the iOS App Store under the title **DiscograFix** – essentially manages your album collection, with a special focus on completeness. After scanning the your iTunes library, each and every album is checked against the studio albums available from the respective artist, with the single source of truth fetched from the [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) open music encyclopedia. Thus, a list of all missing and surplus albums is created, giving you the possibility to buy the missing albums from the iTunes Store and thereby achieve a flawlessly organised collection.

## How to get stared

Simply import the project into your [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) (available on the Mac App Store) and run it in the Simulator. Alternatively, you can also run it on an iPhone that is connected to your Mac while Xcode is opened. Please note that development of this project is not ongoing and the app has only been tested up to iPhone 6.
